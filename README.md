## Projects and Works  

### Computational Finance Thesis
Developed an innovative generative AI model for **Limit Order Book (LOB) simulation** using a **deep-learning State Space Model (Mamba)** in JAX/Python. Generated and validated order book messages, extracted key insights from the data, and benchmarked results.  

**Tags:** `Finance` `Deep Learning` `Generative Models` `Python` `JAX`

### [HangmanBERT](https://github.com/leoguerra97/HangmanProject)
An interactive AI-based **Hangman game** powered by **BERT**, capable of understanding natural language inputs and predicting possible words efficiently. Designed for entertainment and demonstrating NLP capabilities.  

**Tags:** `NLP` `BERT` `Game Development` `Python`

### [Skindrape](https://github.com/leoguerra97/skindrape)  
A demo project showcasing an **image processing pipeline** designed to transform raw garment images into site-ready formats. The pipeline uses a fine-tuned neural network to **segment and isolate garments** from their background.  
- **OpenAI API** processes images to extract structured data, classify garments, and generate enticing descriptions.  
- Includes a **Node.js frontend** for uploading garments, processing them, and organizing them in a gallery classified by type.  

**Tags:** `Image Processing` `Deep Learning` `OpenAI API` `Node.js` `Frontend`

### [StockBERT_Advisor - Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent with NLP Module](https://github.com/leoguerra97/StockBERT_advisor)
Developed a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** that dynamically adapts its investment strategies using an NLP model:  
- **Fine-tuned BERT model** interprets natural language risk preferences and modifies the RL agentâ€™s actions.  
- Agent trades across three assets (Google stock, S&P500, Gold), performing actions like buy, sell, or hold.  
- Integrated **Sharpe ratio** for risk-adjusted decision-making.  

**Tags:** `Reinforcement Learning` `NLP` `Financial Engineering` `Deep Learning`

### [Polimi Master Thesis: Heartfelt Words - ECG Captioning Systems Using DL](https://github.com/leoguerra97/HeartfeltWords)  
Explored the use of **language models (LMs)** to generate clinical reports from ECG signals:  
- Built an **encoder-decoder architecture** using ResNet and GPT-2 to process ECG data and generate medical text.  
- Evaluated performance using BLEU scores and qualitative analysis.  
- Experiments on **multilingual captioning** using English and German datasets.  

**Tags:** `Deep Learning` `NLP` `ECG Captioning` `Medical AI` `GPT-2` `ResNet`

### [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/leoguerra97/ANN_Project)  
Applied **Deep Learning** techniques in **TensorFlow** to solve various tasks:  
- **Image Classification**: ResNet for distinguishing between categories like crops, weeds, and ground.  
- **Image Segmentation**: Used U-Net for agriculture-related segmentation.  
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Answering visual queries using an LSTM-based NLP approach.  

**Tags:** `Deep Learning` `TensorFlow` `Image Classification` `ResNet` `U-Net` `NLP` `LSTM` `VQA`
