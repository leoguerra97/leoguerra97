Hi! I'm **Leo**, a quant and engineer working at the intersection of **financial mathematics**, **machine learning**, **market microstructure modeling**, and **applied NLP / generative AI**. I enjoy taking noisy, highâ€‘frequency or unstructured data and building models, tooling, and research prototypes that can move toward systematic decisionâ€‘making. ðŸ”¥

## Research Themes (current interests)

- **Market Microstructure & Simulation** â€“ modeling messageâ€‘level order flow and synthetic LOB environments.
- **Statistical & ML Signal Construction** â€“ shortâ€‘horizon prediction, riskâ€‘aware transforms, portfolio inputs.
- **NLP Interfaces for Finance** â€“ mapping language (risk prefs, docs, news) into structured model hooks.
- **Alt / Unstructured Data Engineering** â€“ images, docs, sensor series â†’ features useful for modeling.

## Projects & Works

### Computational Finance Master Thesis
**Limit Order Book Simulation with AI / Genâ€‘AIâ€‘inspired Architectures**  
This research explored applying deep / LLMâ€‘inspired sequence models to simulate highâ€‘frequency Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics.  
- Benchmarked model families (incl. Stateâ€‘Space Model variants in JAX) for multiâ€‘event LOB streams.  
- Evaluated eventâ€‘type mix, interâ€‘arrival timing, orderâ€‘size distributions, and midâ€‘price behavior.  
- Investigated and mitigated mode collapse during multiâ€‘step rollouts via sampling strategy + regularization.  
- Proposed latent/embedding encodings to better represent sparse message vocabularies.  
- Collaboration with industry; **code not publicly released**.

### HangmanBERT
An interactive AIâ€‘driven **Hangman** game that combines **BERT** and a **statistical nâ€‘gram prior** to update word probabilities as letters are revealed.  
- Uses an nâ€‘gram frequency model as an initial prior over candidate words.  
- Applies BERT contextual scoring to refine probabilities with partial information.  
- Illustrates sequential Bayesianâ€‘style updating logic that parallels streaming inference problems.

### StockBERT_Advisor â€“ Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent w/ NLP Module
Prototype framework where a **Reinforcement Learning agent** adapts portfolio actions based on **naturalâ€‘language risk instructions** parsed with a fineâ€‘tuned BERT model.  
- Text input (risk tolerance, constraints) mapped into agent behavior modifiers.  
- Trades across three assets (Google, S&P 500, Gold) with buy/sell/hold actions.  
- Incorporates **Sharpe ratio** in reward shaping for riskâ€‘adjusted decisions.

### Markowitz Optimization and Bank Default Prediction
Two related finance modeling exercises in a single repository.  
1. **Markowitz Optimization**  
   - Rollingâ€‘window portfolio construction experiments.  
   - Constraint scenarios: noâ€‘short, regularization (Lasso / Ridge) to stabilize estimates.  
   - Visualizes efficient frontier movement over time.  
2. **Bank Default Prediction**  
   - Builds and compares models to flag potential bank defaults.  
   - Includes diagnostic and interpretability visualizations.

### Polimi Master Thesis: *Heartfelt Words* â€“ ECG Captioning with DL
Used language modeling to generate structured clinical text from ECG signals.  
- **Encoderâ€“decoder** architecture: ResNetâ€‘style signal encoder + modified GPTâ€‘2 text decoder.  
- Generated narrative/diagnostic captions from timeâ€‘series inputs.  
- Evaluated with BLEU scores and qualitative assessment.  
- Explored multilingual captioning (English / German datasets).
