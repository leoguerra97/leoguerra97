## Projects and Works  

### [Computational Finance Thesis]
This thesis explores the application of **AI** and **Large Language Model (LLM)-inspired techniques** for simulating Limit Order Books (LOBs) in financial markets.  
- Investigated benchmarking, optimal model architectures, and stress-testing for LOB simulations.  
- Focused on predicting event types, timing, and mid-price movements while addressing mode collapse.  
- Proposed latent space encoding and customized loss functions to enhance model robustness.  

This research highlights the potential of AI-driven LOB simulations in understanding market microstructure and liquidity dynamics.

### [HangmanBERT](https://github.com/leoguerra97/HangmanProject)  
An interactive AI-based **Hangman game** that combines **BERT** with a **statistical n-gram model**:  
- The statistical model provides initial word predictions based on input letters.  
- BERT fine-tunes predictions by leveraging natural language understanding.  
This project is a fun demonstration of **Statistical Modelling** and **NLP** techniques and offers potential for **alpha research** by simulating decision-making scenarios.

**Tags:** `NLP` `BERT` `Statistical Models` `Game Development` `Python`

### [StockBERT_Advisor - Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent with NLP Module](https://github.com/leoguerra97/StockBERT_advisor)  
Developed a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** that dynamically adapts its investment strategies using an NLP model:  
- **Fine-tuned BERT model** interprets natural language risk preferences and modifies the RL agentâ€™s actions.  
- Agent trades across three assets (Google stock, S&P500, Gold), performing actions like buy, sell, or hold.  
- Integrated **Sharpe ratio** for risk-adjusted decision-making.  

**Tags:** `Reinforcement Learning` `NLP` `Financial Engineering` `Deep Learning`

### [Polimi Master Thesis: Heartfelt Words - ECG Captioning Systems Using DL](https://github.com/leoguerra97/HeartfeltWords)  
Explored the use of **language models (LMs)** to generate clinical reports from ECG signals:  
- Built an **encoder-decoder architecture** using ResNet and GPT-2 with modified encoding to process ECG data and generate medical text.  
- Evaluated performance using BLEU scores and qualitative analysis.  
- Experiments on **multilingual captioning** using English and German datasets.  

**Tags:** `Deep Learning` `NLP` `ECG Captioning` `Medical AI` `GPT-2` `ResNet`

### [Markowitz Optimization and Bank Default Prediction](https://github.com/leoguerra97/Markowitz_and_Default)  
This project tackles two key tasks:  
1. **Markowitz Optimization**:  
   - Visualizes the effects of constraints like **no short selling** and **regularization** (Lasso and Ridge).  
   - Employs a rolling window train-test approach for portfolio optimization.  
2. **Bank Default Prediction**:  
   - Develops a predictive model for identifying bank defaults.  
   - Includes detailed visualizations of prediction results for interpretability.  

**Tags:** `Finance` `Optimization` `Predictive Modeling` `Visualization`

### [Skindrape](https://github.com/leoguerra97/skindrape)  
A demo project for a startup idea showcasing an **image processing pipeline** designed to transform raw garment images into site-ready formats.  
- **Neural Network** segments garments from their background.  
- **OpenAI API** extracts structured data, classifies garments, and generates enticing product descriptions.  
- Includes a **Node.js frontend** for uploading garments, processing them, and organizing them in a gallery classified by type.  

**Tags:** `Image Processing` `Deep Learning` `OpenAI API` `Node.js` `Frontend`

### [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/leoguerra97/ANN_Project)  
Applied **Deep Learning** techniques in **TensorFlow** to solve various tasks:  
- **Image Classification**: ResNet for distinguishing between categories like crops, weeds, and ground.  
- **Image Segmentation**: Used U-Net for agriculture-related segmentation.  
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Answering visual queries using an LSTM-based NLP approach.  

**Tags:** `Deep Learning` `TensorFlow` `Image Classification` `ResNet` `U-Net` `NLP` `LSTM` `VQA`
