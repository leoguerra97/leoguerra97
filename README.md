ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Leonardo, a passionate data scientist and software engineer with expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and financial engineering. Welcome to my GitHub profile!


Projects and works

Computational Finance Thesis:
Developed an innovative generative AI model for LOB simulation using a deep-learning State Space Model (Mamba) in JAX/Python. Generated and validated order book messages, extracted key insights from the data, and benchmarked results.
Tags:

HangmanBERT:

Skindrape:
A demo project showcasing an image processing pipeline designed to transform raw garment images into site-ready formats. The pipeline uses a fine-tuned neural network to segment and isolate the garment from its background. OpenAI's API then analyzes the image to extract structured data, classify the garment, and generate an enticing product description. Additionally, the project includes a Node.js frontend for uploading garments, processing them, and organizing them in a gallery classified by type.
